Algae Alert.
===================
Algae Alert is the first demo App from EcoSleuth.
EcoSleuth is an architecture designed to crowdsource environmental data by connecting citizen scientists with data analysts via an open source database.
This architecture will be utilized by citizen scientists through interest-specific mobile applications.
The applications may be pre-existing apps with the ability to connect to EcoSleuth and submit data, or they may be specialized apps incorporating the EcoSleuth architecture.
Upon submission, the data will be uploaded anonymously to an open source database for analysis by other scientists, researchers, and government agencies.
Both the app users and data analysts will have the ability to create submission templates and upload them a template marketplace.
App users can then customize their own submission apps with these templates.
